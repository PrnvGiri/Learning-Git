To add a file to the repository
1. Use the git add command followed by the name of the file you want to add. 
2. Once you've added all the files you want to commit, use the git commit command to create a new commit with your changes.
3. Finally, use the git push command to push your changes to the remote repository.

For Example:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add index.html file"
git push
